Someone said online that the 300mm canon variable was bad. Well it's still really sharp and the adjustable range is handy. People online are also often stupid. 
Also, it has AF unlike the vintage lenses. It struggles when its dark, which sucks because it was partly cloudy. Had to throw out some shots because I couldn't get the shutter speed any lower and my hands are shaky.
Clouds cleared up when king julian appeard.
I have no idea how to color grade animals.
