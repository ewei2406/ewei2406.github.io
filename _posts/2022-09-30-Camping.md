Went camping before my first year at UVA and tried out long exposure photography of the night sky.
I didn't quite get the ISO right though (lot of hot pixels?). 
The dirt is scary for the camera.

Lessons learned:
- don't get dirt in the camera
- don't get dirt in the camera
- don't get dirt in the camera

Lessons not learned:
